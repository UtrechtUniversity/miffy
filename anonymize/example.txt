Subject: President U.S. refuses to pay WHO contribution
We'll give you thirty days and then there should be 'substantial improvements' in the organisation. 
That's the message U.S. President Donald Trump sent to the health organization WHO. 
If not, the organization can no longer expect money from the United States. 
Why did Trump set an ultimatum and how much does the US contribute to the WHO? 
We are discussing this with American expert Willem Post.
